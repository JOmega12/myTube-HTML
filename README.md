This is the first HTML Project that implements HTML source code from using images, tables, and forms.
The instruction follows: 

1. This is to be done with HTML ONLY. (For your Module 2 project you'll be tasked with adding CSS to this MyTube project).
2. The index.html  file will be the "home page" of your website.
3. Your website will have four (4) pages. The navbar will include 4 links to get to these different pages:
    - **Home page:** This will show 3 "featured" videos (1 from each collection) - Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.
    - **Collection pages: **
        - You will have three (3) collections/category pages.
        - Each page will have a collection of YouTube videos of your choice (i.e. Cars).
        - Each collection page will have six (6) videos relevant to the collection/category.
        - Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.
        - Each YouTube video will have a clickable title beneath it that navigates the user to its "video details page"
    - **Video details page:**
        - This page should include the YouTube video associated with the title that was clicked, along with its title and a short paragraph about the video. You can use lorem ipsum text for video descriptions.
        - Videos on this page WILL be allowed full screen.
    - **Video Upload page:**
        - This will include a form (non-functional) to mimic "uploading" videos to your channel.
        - The <input> and <label> elements should include ALL required attributes as if it were a working form.
        - Pay special attention to the form mockup below to know what elements the form must include.
        - The radio buttons must toggle correctly (one selected at a time)
4. HTML must follow a consistent indentation pattern. (HTML style guide)
5. No large gaps/empty space between elements.
6. Read these requirements again before submitting your assignment to make sure you have covered each point.
